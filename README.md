# Muletaur
This is a text based game of min/maxing. Great for both the shrewd and the blind. 
You start in a magical medieval world as a half-donkey/half-centaur courier, traveling salesman, and general money maker coming up with the brilliant idea to employ adventurers to gather valuables for you. Hire, manage, and equip a team of your choosing while juggling a vast inventory of loot to sell. It's time to get rich!

It is open source and written in java.

## Start Playing
In the future a graphical front end will be included, but for now, you must access the game using any telnet program you desire which will connect to the server of your choice. Find friends to compete with on the reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/Muletaur/) or play solo by downloading and running the server yourself. 

Once you have the addess of the server the typical way to connect is to type: "**telnet [address] 4001**" in the command shell or terminal. (without the quotes)

Compiled executables of the server are listed in the root of this Muletaur github repo (https://github.com/Heaven1/Muletaur). 

## Telnet
Telnet is a computer protocol that connects your computer with a remote server (or your own server). A barebones implementation of it is included in most operating system although to access it you may initially have to jump through a couple hoops. In addition there are many free and commericial telnet clients available which often come with many bells and whistles such as the ability to make aliases and automatically trigger certain automation when a specific scenario occurs.

### Windows
This webpage provides a step by step guide on how to enable telnet on your windows 10 computer:

### Linux
By default telnet is available from a terminal.

### TinTin++
TinTin (https://tintin.mudhalla.net/) is a free telnet client typically used for a class of video games called MUDs, but will work just fine for Muletaur. It includes advanced scripting capabilities to make things much easier with some time invested in learning it. 
Use the command "**#session muletaur {server address} {port}**" to connect to the game server after it has been started. (without the quotes)
